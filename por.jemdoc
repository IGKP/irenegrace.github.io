== Positions of Responsibility

== Society of Aerospace Engineering
I am the [https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/team-members Batch Representative Y18] at the Society of Aerospace Engineers. My tasks involve the tasks of a liaison between the administration and my batchmates. Outside this, I helped arrange events and workshops as a part of the SAE's functioning. \n
One of my most cherished memories with SAE are those from our visit to HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited).\n


== Aquatics Team
I was appointed as the summer camp captain for the Aquatics team in the Summer 2019-20. My tasks involved facilitating the smooth functioning of summer camp and other events such as 5KM sim events in the summer. The summer camp was our training for the upcoming 54th InterIIT at IIT Kharagpur where our time secured the overall 3rd position.\n
